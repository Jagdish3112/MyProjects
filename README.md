Developed a backend-focused Bank
 Management System in Java, leveraging JDBC for database
 interactions with MySQL. The system automates core banking
 functions such as managing savings/checking accounts,
 processing transactions, and storing account details securely.
 Key features include seamless transaction management
 (deposits, withdrawals, transfers), account management (CRUD
 operations for account details), and robust database integration
 with MySQL for real-time data storage. Implemented security
 measures including error handling, transaction rollbacks, and
 SQL query sanitization to prevent SQL injection. This case study
 demonstrates proficiency in backend development and database
 management for banking systems
